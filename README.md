# ~~Messenger bypasser~~

**THIS APP IS DISCONTINUATED AS [SlimSocial for Facebook](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=SlimSOcial&fdid=it.rignanese.leo.slimfacebook) MAKES IT IRRELEVANT**

Since version 2, this app is a fork of Tinfoil for Facebook which handles correctly the Messenger part of the website.

Version 1.x.y: Teeny-tiny Android app for bypassing the requirement for Messenger. In certain conditions, Facebook forces the start of Messenger, which crashes the browser (i.e. Tinfoil for Facebook). This app intercepts this start to prevent the crash and sends back the user to the webapp.
